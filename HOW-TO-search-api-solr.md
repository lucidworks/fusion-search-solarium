## How to build a search UI with Lucidworks Managed Search and search_api_solr

[search_api_solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) is a Drupal module that allows building search UIs with Solr as a backend.

In this post, we will cover how to use [Lucidworks search_api_solr](link-to-project) module to build search UIs.

Pre-requisite: You will first need to install a Drupal site. You can follow the instructions mentioned over [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/install) to achieve that.

Assuming you have PHP installed with a web server, we recommend setting up the drupal site using composer.

```composer create-project drupal/recommended-project drupal-site-search```

This will create a project in 'drupal-site-search' and automatically executes composer install to download the latest stable version of Drupal 8 and all its dependencies.

You can read more about the installation steps using composer over [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies#download-core).

After following the standard install process, you should see the site looking something like below:

### Step 1: Install Lucidworks search_api_solr

We will start by installing the `search_api_solr` project.

```composer require drupal/search_api_solr```

TODO: Update to Lucidworks published module name

Next, we're going to install the following three modules by going to the `Extend` menu:

- Search API
- Search API Solr
- Search API Solr Search Defaults

The Search API Solr Search Defaults module provides a default setup of Search API which would save us time to create one from scratch.

In addition to this, we should uninstall the default `Search` module of Drupal since we're going to configure one that's using Solr.

Here's a GIF showing the above process.

### Step 1A: For users of search_api_solr module

While testing this blog post out, you're likely to use the public [search_api_solr](https://www.drupal.org/project/search_api_solr) module. You need to follow these additional steps:

```
export COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1
composer require symfony/event-dispatcher:"4.3.4 as 3.4.35"
composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies
```

A brief explanation of the above steps:

1. The default memory limit imposed by composer may be too low as we install additional dependencies. The first command unsets memory limit constraint.
2. The latest version of search_api_solr recommends this particular step. More info on it over [here](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/search_api_solr#installation).
3. This reads the composer.json file from the
  current directory, processes it, and updates, removes or installs all the dependencies.

Further, in your site project, go to the file `web/modules/contrib/search_api_solr/src/SolrConnector/SolrConnectorPluginBase.php` and around L157 within the `buildConfigurationForm` function definition, add the following two form items: 

```php
$form['oauth2_client_id'] = [
    '#type' => 'textfield',
    '#title' => $this->t('OAuth2 Client ID'),
    '#description' => $this->t('OAuth2 Client ID.'),
    '#default_value' => isset($this->configuration['oauth2_client_id']) ? $this->configuration['oauth2_client_id'] : '0oa3j6emghW1EvQ9P357',
    '#required' => TRUE,
];

$form['oauth2_client_secret'] = [
    '#type' => 'textfield',
    '#title' => $this->t('OAuth2 Client Secret'),
    '#description' => $this->t('OAuth2 Client Secret.'),
    '#default_value' => isset($this->configuration['oauth2_client_secret']) ? $this->configuration['oauth2_client_secret'] : 'WTjGhFCh1z5gntC38WM5d36xe1kAtOw8hh-Kdv0y',
    '#required' => TRUE,
];
```

Finally, you will replace the `vendor/solarium/solarium/src` directory with the LucidWorks variant's src directory from [here](https://github.com/MarcusSorealheis/lms-php/tree/5.x).

`Note:` This entire step will not be needed for end users as the published module will handle these changes internally.

### Step 2: Configure the Search API Module

Go to the `Configuration` tab and select `Search API` menu within it.

Once here, select the Server option. To begin with, the STATUS might read as `Unavailable`.

Click on the Edit Operation for the server.

Select a server name and choose `Solr Cloud` as the option.

![](https://imgur.com/GOn8g6L.png)

Next, enter the config options for:

1. HTTP protocol - choose HTTPS
2. Solr node - use your host name, e.g. `pg01.us-west1.cloud.lucidworks.com`
3. Pick port as 443
4. Choose Solr Path. For LMS, this is `/:customer_id/:cluster_id`
5. Set your OAuth2 Client ID and Client Secret values
6. Set your default Solr collection to a collection that exists in your cluster. Here, I've chosen `drupal-site-search`.

Optionally, you can set the HTTP Method for search as `GET` for better caching.

### Step 3: Setting the Schema via configset

Although, we have configured our Solr backend, you're likely to see the following error screen:

![](https://imgur.com/nccBILR.png)

You can download the configset and upload it to LucidWorks Managed Search. However, Lucidworks Managed Search doesn't allow uploading of untrusted `<lib>` paths. Prior to uploading this configset, you will need to edit `solrconfig.xml` and remove all the lib references.

Alternatively, you can use this [configset directly](drupal-site-search-configset.zip) and upload it instead.


```
curl --location --request POST 'https://pg01.us-west1.cloud.lucidworks.com/php-test/php-test/solr/admin/configs?action=UPLOAD&name=drupal-new-search' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--data-binary '@drupal-new-search-configset.zip'
```

The above API call uses `$TOKEN` which requires a valid Bearer token. You can get one via the following REST API call:


```sh
curl -X POST \
  https://cloud.lucidworks.com/oauth2/default/$customer_id/v1/token \
  -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' -H 'Cache-control: no-cache' \
  -H 'authorization: Basic base64($oauth2_client_id:$oauth2_client_secret)' \
  -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=com.lucidworks.cloud.search.solr.customer'

Response Format:

{
    "token_type":"Bearer",
    "access_token":"$TOKEN",
    "scope":"com.lucidworks.cloud.search.solr.customer",
    "expires_in":3599
}
```

Once you've uploaded the config set, you can visit the Solr Admin UI to create a collection with the config set applied.

`Note`: If you had already set a collection in the drupal site, delete the collection prior to re-creating it with the config set.

Once you have done this step, your drupal site should show that everything is successfully configured.

### Step 4: Generating Site Data And Indexing It

First, we will add some data. Install the [`devel`](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) module which provides some tools to generate site data.

```
composer require drupal/devel
```

Next, go to the `Extend` tab and add the Devel Generate module.

![](https://imgur.com/iYBcvf5.png)

Next, go to the `Configuration` tab and select `Generate Content` menu.

![](https://imgur.com/B0AcZuu.png)

Select some options and once you save, your site will have dummy content generated.

![](https://imgur.com/nvMmNJH.png)

Since our Search API module is already configured, this data would've been indexed in our Solr backend already.

We can confirm this by going to the Configuration > Search API > Solr Index menu.

![](https://imgur.com/LJdk9jU.png)

We can also confirm this by making a search query from Solr Admin UI.

### Step 5: Search Content

Our search is already configured, thanks to the `Search API Solr Search Defaults` module.

We can confirm this by going to Structure > Views tab.

![](https://imgur.com/fJJJ4Xg.png)

Go to the Solr Search Content view.

![](https://imgur.com/vSnSG31.png)

Here, you can edit the page path from the default `/solr-search/content/` to something more obvious like `/search`.

Great! Now, let's visit the search page. Our search is configured to work with Lucidworks Managed Search.
